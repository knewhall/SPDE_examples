# SPDE_examples
This code has example finite discretizations of stochastic partial differential equations with tunable correlations in the noise

Fig1: covariance matrix for creating colored noise with two different boundary conditions

Fig2: simulate the SPDE with different correlations at two different temperatures and collect statistics on the energy distribution sampled
